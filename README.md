This repo contains material for a ~ 4 hour codealong that was held at Karolinska.
 
The workshop was aimed at complete beginners. In the workshop codealong we went from basic Python coding to conducting Data Manipulation, visualizations and statistical analysis.
In the end we played around with some more advanced topics applying Unsupervised Machine Learning on new Covid Data and creating classification models for predicting malignant cancer.
